[{"content":" Searching for a meaning: experiencing beauty amidst tragedy I used to be a big fan of gy!be, but I was fairly young and never looked into the meanings and political subtexts of their albums. As years passed, the way I listened to their music never really changed and kind of became even more passive, like a good, emotional background music that\u0026rsquo;s perfect for car trips. That\u0026rsquo;s one of the reasons why finding out about this release has been such a nice surprise for me. For most people, the band\u0026rsquo;s political involvement might be obvious, as well as their sympathy with the Palestinian cause, which was quite explicit in Yanqui U.X.O. (2002), but that wasn\u0026rsquo;t the case for me before listening to this album and I\u0026rsquo;m really glad that it made me look deeper into their music and history.\nThe album opens with timid, eerie screams in a desolate silence, accompanied by a hum that evokes the ringing in the ear after an explosion, but it wastes no time transitioning into nostalgic notes of a languid beauty that never completely fades away.\nThe first climax in \u0026ldquo;BABYS IN A THUNDERCOLD\u0026rdquo; sends chills down your spine but is for sure quieter than the heights reached in lift your skinny fists. The second climax feels mournful and angry rather than glorious and hopeful, and the descending strings scales is reminiscing of the F#A# post apocalyptic atmosphere, blending everything in a mix that fits the theme really well.\nRAINDROPS CAST IN LEAD opens with the peaceful atmosphere of a summer morning that\u0026rsquo;s a bit too hot to enjoy and quickly gains momentum, kind of continuing the previous track and evoking the image of a fight and resistence that doesn\u0026rsquo;t stop, day after day. Then the night comes along with the only spoken words in the album which are just heartbreaking\n\u0026ldquo;BROKEN SPIRES AT DEAD KAPITAL\u0026rdquo; feels like a damaged recording from a somewhat Schindler\u0026rsquo;s-list-esque soundtrack in which the dramatic double bass, drums and violin evolve into a less classical and more post-rock sound, gently bridging to the cynical sound of \u0026ldquo;PALE SPECTATOR TAKES PHOTOGRAPHS\u0026rdquo;, in which the indifference to tragedy and the apathy in growing accustomed to horror become increasingly loud.\nThen comes \u0026ldquo;GREY RUBBLE - GREEN SHOOTS\u0026rdquo;, the final track of the album, which sums it all up: the anger, the despair, the question \u0026ldquo;what is there to say that wouldn\u0026rsquo;t feel like little more than pointless compassion void of any value and meaning?\u0026rdquo;.\n\u0026ldquo;NO TITLE\u0026rdquo; reminds us that in a world filled with tragedy and man-made horrors beyond our understanding, looking for a reason, or even something as simple as words to comment on the state of things is naive and futile. Instead, we must resist even in times where hope is but a luxury, knowing that the only thing that can save us is the experience of beauty and the bliss the comes with it, so abstract yet present in the very real things of our everyday life, the objects of our gazing and all of our senses. As the tracks flow one after the other, we are invited to stop rationalizing the external world as well as our thoughts, and start experiencing our mind as a physical and sensible reality and viceversa, unveiling the true nature of one\u0026rsquo;s self and removing any layer of romanticization and mystification, in the most gy!be-heartbreaking-yet-peaceful way.\n\u0026quot;\nTHE PLAIN TRUTH==\nwe drifted through it, arguing.\nevery day a new war crime, every day a flower bloom.\nwe sat down together and wrote it in one room,\nand then sat down in a different room, recording.\nNO TITLE= what gestures make sense while tiny bodies fall? what context? what broken melody?\nand then a tally and a date to mark a point on the line, the negative process, the growing pile.\nthe sun setting above beds of ash\nwhile we sat together, arguing.\nthe old world order barely pretended to care.\nthis new century will be crueler still.\nwar is coming.\ndon’t give up.\npick a side.\nhang on.\nlove.\n\u0026quot;\n-GY!BE\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/piazdreblog/posts/gybe/","summary":"Searching for a meaning: experiencing beauty amidst tragedy I used to be a big fan of gy!be, but I was fairly young and never looked into the meanings and political subtexts of their albums.

The show is incredibly witty yet profound, and I encourage anyone reading this to give it a shot if they haven\u0026rsquo;t already. Obviously, there\u0026rsquo;s a lot I could say about it, but I\u0026rsquo;m not going to make an in-depth review. Instead, I\u0026rsquo;ll talk only about a specific aspect.\nAbout the fourth wall breaking Phoebe Waller-Bridge absolutely slaying\nI\u0026rsquo;ve seen some criticism on the frequent use of the fourth wall breaking, especially in the first season, however I find that Fleabag makes a clear point throughout the series as to how that isn\u0026rsquo;t just some narrative device that holds comedic value and nothing more. Not only does it contribute to the whole theatrical atmosphere that permeates the work (as a matter of fact, an early iteration of the show was initially written as a 10 minutes stand-up performance as the result of a challenge by a friend, only to be later transcribed into a theatrical monologue in 2013 and a TV show in 2016), it also is incredibly fitting and functional to address the theme of life as a performative act.\nDespite all the personal informations and thoughts the main character gives us through the fourth wall breaking, we as spectators don\u0026rsquo;t even know her real name. She\u0026rsquo;s Fleabag, she\u0026rsquo;s all the masks she\u0026rsquo;s wearing and yet she\u0026rsquo;s none of them. Any of us could be or could have been Fleabag. As some have rightfully noted, the second season makes a less frequent use of the fourth wall breaking, but that should be analyzed in terms of character growth rather than a stylistic reassessment, given that the counseling session scene and many interactions with the \u0026ldquo;hot priest\u0026rdquo; explicitly signal how these could very much be dissociative episodes of complete detachment from reality and the outside world, with Fleabag being present only inside her head, talking to us spectators. In fact, despite her tendency to fall into the same self-sabotage vicious cycle, we do see a significant growth from Fleabag, who chooses to stop using sex as a way to keep her mind busy and away from the aspects of her life she can\u0026rsquo;t cope with, in an effort to be more present in her own mind\nOf course, that isn\u0026rsquo;t the solution, because life doesn\u0026rsquo;t work like that as there\u0026rsquo;s an extrinsic element of guilt to the choice, also sorella etc etc prete etc etc ciao mi sono stancato non mi toccate fleabag\nConclusions super bella state zitti ziopera, unica mia lamentela è il trauma di Boo l\u0026rsquo;hanno un po\u0026rsquo; lasciato cadere lì dopo la prima stagione, si poteva vedere meglio l\u0026rsquo;aspetto del conviverci e convivere coi sensi di colpa\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/piazdreblog/posts/fleabag-review/","summary":"In the last few days, I finally committed to watching Fleabag, a very short comedy-drama show written (and interpreted) by the brilliant English actress and screenwriter Phoebe Waller-Bridge.
