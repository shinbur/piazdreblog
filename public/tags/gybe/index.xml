&lt;h3 id=&#34;searching-for-a-meaning-experiencing-beauty-amidst-tragedy&#34;&gt;Searching for a meaning: experiencing beauty amidst tragedy&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I used to be a big fan of gy!be, but I was fairly young and never looked into the meanings and political subtexts of their albums. As years passed, the way I listened to their music never really changed and kind of became even more passive, like a good, emotional background music that&amp;rsquo;s perfect for car trips. That&amp;rsquo;s one of the reasons why finding out about this release has been such a nice surprise for me. For most people, the band&amp;rsquo;s political involvement might be obvious, as well as their sympathy with the Palestinian cause, which was quite explicit in Yanqui U.X.O. (2002), but that wasn&amp;rsquo;t the case for me before listening to this album and I&amp;rsquo;m really glad that it made me look deeper into their music and history.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
